## How can I help?

Over the course of this project, we will have (or have had) opportunities to help with design, development, QA & testing, writing, and more. To contribute, you can:

- Report a bug or request a feature by opening a new issue.
- Review [open issues](https://github.com/currychern/bounti/issues) and leave a comment if you'd like to help or if you need more information.

### Design

Here is a link to our [design assets and documentation](./design). Here are [open issues labeled "Design"](https://github.com/currychern/bounti/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Adesign) where you can discuss, provide feedback or volunteer to help.

### Development

[Issues marked with the code label](https://github.com/currychern/bounti/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acode) are bugs or features that require some knowledge of javascript, React Native, or Firebase.

Issues with the help wanted label indicate where the best place to start are, but contributions are welcome on any open issue. Please leave a comment before you start working in case work is underway from another contributor.
