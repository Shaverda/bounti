## Welcome!

We're Bounti! Our team includes developers and designers. We are looking for more stakeholders in the community to be involved in the project. We are also looking for a project co-lead to help onboard new members, prioritize tasks, help with documentation, and conduct community outreach.

We are interested in bringing attention to the issue of wasted food and we are excited about the potential to get everyone in the community benefiting from less waste.

Thanks for coming here to learn more!

## Project Description

We are a team of developers and designers working to build an app that allows neighbors to share surplus food to help alleviate hunger and end food waste.

Here in the United States, we waste about 40% of the food we produce. Meanwhile, 1 out of every 6 households in here in Texas suffers from food insecurity. Teenagers and college students avoid asking for food assistance due to the social stigma around hunger and poverty. We hope to engage this audience and the broader community by making a network where sharing food is not only acceptable, but encouraged. :grinning::clap:

Our app complements the efforts of food recovery organizations by focusing on the food we as individuals waste everyday. We are creating a peer-to-peer network to make everyone an active stakeholder in helping solve the problem of wasted food! :yum::fork_and_knife:

## Recent News

Bounti was started at [ATX Hack for Change](atxhackforchange.org). We got a lot done during the hackathon and are trying to continue the momentum for a MVP rollout.

We're currently meeting in real life twice a month at [Open Austin's](https://www.open-austin.org/) Civic Hack Nights, check [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Austin/) for upcoming hack nights.

## Roadmap

At this stage, we have:

1. v2 designs of Bounti. See examples [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/currychern/bounti/master/public/assets/mockup_hackathon_final.png) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/currychern/bounti/master/public/assets/mockup_hackathon_final_2.png) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/currychern/bounti/master/public/assets/mockup_hackathon_final_3.png).

2. A prototype that still needs a fair amount of work to get to version 1.0.

We are currently working on:

1. Implementing the v2 designs of Bounti.

2. Pulling data from Firebase.

3. Creating the form submission page.

We are looking for more developers with React Native and Firebase experience and a project co-lead to help us achieve our goal.

### Additional Contributors
- [Bryan Chang](https://github.com/gitbchang) - React Native

### Design

Here is a link to our [design assets and documentation](./design). Here are [open issues labeled "Design"](https://github.com/currychern/bounti/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Adesign) where you can discuss, provide feedback or volunteer to help.

### Development

The Bounti app is primarily written in javascript and uses the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) library. We have future plans to implement [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). Data submitted to the server lives in [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), a Google cloud service.

**Getting started**

This project has a dependency on Node and npm. Make sure they are install on your machine by running the following commands:
`node -v`
`npm -v`

This should return the version number of your install.
If it doesn't Google how to install Node & npm for your operating system.
_Maybe these links could help you?_
- [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04)
- [Mac](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-mac-os-x/)

We recommend using the yarn package manager to install the project. You can check if it is on your machine by running: `yarn -v`

You can run the following command to install yarn:

`npm install -g yarn`

Once you have cloned this repo to you local machine, open the `bounti` directory in your Terminal.

`cd bounti`

### Installation

1. `yarn install`

### Using Expo

The project uses [Expo](https://expo.io/), which enables you to view the app directly on your phone instead of an emulator.

1. Download the Expo App on your phone.

2. Make sure your phone and your machine are connected to the same local network. (An easy way to do this is to open a mobile hotspot and connect your computer to your phone's network).

### Starting the App

1. `npm start`

2. scan the QR code using the Expo app OR if you are using an emulator [follow these directions](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v17.0.0/introduction/installation.html)
