## The Problem

[![Vox - Food Waste](http://img.youtube.com/vi/6RlxySFrkIM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlxySFrkIM)

Americans waste an unbelievable amount of food. According to a 2016 [_Guardian_ report](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect), roughly 50 percent of all produce in the United States is thrown away. Produce alone accounts for 60 million tons (or $160 billion) worth of wasted food.

A lot of resources go into creating food: water, land, labor, time. For it to end up in a landfill is a travesty. Within the US, discarded food is the [largest component](https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/sustainable-management-food-basics) of landfill and incinerators. This is a huge environmental problem. Wasted food is a rising source of methane, a far more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

The [2016 Food Sustainability Index](http://foodsustainability.eiu.com/us/) ranked the US third-to-last when it came to food waste (23rd out of 25) with (30-40%) of all food produced in the country going to waste - more than 20 pounds per person per month! This lost food costs about $1,600 a year for a family of four.

This is happening while more than [13% of Americans live in food insecure households](http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/hunger-and-poverty/hunger-and-poverty-fact-sheet.html). Here in Texas, the rate of food insecurity is even higher - [15.4% of Texas households](https://www.feedingtexas.org/learn/food-insecurity/) experience food insecurity. This is why wasted food is such a big problem. People are still hungry.

It doesn't need to be this way. We aren't just wasting a lot of food. We are wasting a lot of _good_ food. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for a Livable Future released a study that looks at the nutritional value of the food we waste. It turns out the food we waste could feed a [healthy diet to two-thirds](http://newfoodeconomy.com/food-waste-adds-healthy-diet-two-thirds-american-population/) of Americans.

It's for this reason we are starting this project to connect neighbors and allow them to share surplus food. We want our community to be more informed about wasted food and to directly benefit from reducing needless waste. We also hope to partner with local food rescue programs, homeless shelters, food kitchens, and food banks to support access to good food for the food insecure in our community. If you are interested in being involved, please [contact](#contact) us.

## FAQs

### ATX Hack for Change
> Q: How did you hear about this event?

A: I heard about the event during an Open Austin Hack Night.

> Q: Short description of the project (140 characters)

A: Bounti is an app that allows neighbors to share surplus food so it won't go to waste. We hope to foster community and help end food waste.

> Q: What is your idea? Who will it help?

A: We are working on an app that allows neighbors to share surplus food so it won't go to waste. A user can list food items they are offering and other users can claim them. All coordination and communication can be done in app. We also want to make the app educational and give users weekly tips on ways they can reduce food waste. We'll want to collect data so we can measure the impact we're having. We're making this app open to everyone in the Austin community. We want to support access to good food for the food insecure and work with local food rescue programs, homeless shelters, food kitchens, and food banks to accomplish this goal. We also want to connect our users with local farmers, grocers, and restaurants that implement sustainable practices. Reducing wasted food will lessen the amount of waste that ends up in city landfills and associated greenhouse gas emissions. We hope that the city and all its residents will benefit from our project on some level.

> Q: What is the current state of your idea?

A: We have finished scoping out the basic premise of the app, settled on design, engineering, and project management guidelines, and have started making mockups. Here's a link to a mockup we made: (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/currychern/bounti/master/public/assets/app_mockup.png). We will begin designing a prototype soon.

> Q: Do you have text, articles, data, code, etc.?

A: Our goal is to create a mobile app. We have a github repository (https://github.com/currychern/bounti) and will update it with code and other assets leading up to the hackathon. We have a brief synopsis of the problem and links to articles highlighting the problem with food waste here (https://github.com/currychern/bounti#the-problem). Did you know: with the food we waste, we could feed a healthy diet to two-thirds of Americans.

> Q: What skills do you think your project might need?

A: We are looking for developers and UI/UX designers to help us with feature development. But we also want to find people who are passionate about sustainable consumption and preventing wasted food.

> Q: Will the project need maintenance after the event?

A: Yes, we plan on continuing the project after the event. I will continue working on maintenance and feature development, but would love to find others willing to work on the project long term.

> Q: Have you attended any of our pre-hack workshops?

A: Yes, I attended the workshop on Hackathon Tech + Tools.

> Q: Who are you? What gets you up in the morning?

A: I am an engineer who is excited by new challenges and motivated by making a positive impact in the local community. I am interested in sustainable practices in the production and consumption of food and have been learning as much about the problem as I can: from volunteering at a local farm to helping a food recovery organization to growing my own food in a community garden plot.

> Q: Can you be present Friday June 2nd - Sunday June 4

A: Yes, I can be present all weekend.

> Q: What U.N Global Goal does this fall under?

A: 12) Responsible Production and Consumption
